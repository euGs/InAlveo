# InAlveo
In Alveo is an exploration of the connection between mother and baby during a natural birth. You are with your baby for every movement (s)he has to make to navigate the birth canal. Through a multi-sensory interaction you use your own rhythms to support your baby. A nest-like environment helps you to open, connect and let go.

In Alveo is a collaboration between [SÃ© Sneaky](http://sesneaky.com), Joa Ritter, [Yoko Iki](http://yokoiki.com/) and [Sarah Hermanutz](http://sarahhermanutz.com/)
